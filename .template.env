# Okay this one above is a bit tricky. It is used to encrypt and decrypt the mail in the database.
# It is a JSON object with two keys, key and iv. Both are Buffer objects. What you need to understand is
# that the idea is to have a data and an iv that are the exact same size than the randomly generated example above.
# It's the AES256 encryption protocol that requires this. Wanna know more ? Google it ig
